# UFC-Scraper
Personal Project for learning to scrape data and build model from scratch. 

Still a work in progress. 

As of 02/06/2021

Completed: Scraping and tidying of historical data and next events.

Current Task: start fine tuning potential models for better accuracy

Next Steps: look over previous work to see if any dropped data/rows can be put back in under different conditions. Look at external literature for ideas to improve model


As of 07/05/2021

Completed:        Historical data scraped (minor fixes/adjustments still to be made). Scraped data has been cleaned. 

Current task:     Creating a linear regression for several stats to fill in missing values. 

Next steps:       Input missing values, then convert historical data to format compatible with data scraped for future events. Then build models.
