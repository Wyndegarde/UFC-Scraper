# Progress Log

## 14/05/23

Began refactoring the correct way.

## 30/11/2021

Changed formatting from Ipynb file to several py files. 

Still to add prediction file.

Next steps: Improve code in each file. Learn to create branch from VScode and work from there. 


## 02/06/2021

Completed: Scraping and tidying of historical data and next events.

Current Task: start fine tuning potential models for better accuracy

Next Steps: look over previous work to see if any dropped data/rows can be put back in under different conditions. Look at external literature for ideas to improve model


##  07/05/2021

Completed:        Historical data scraped (minor fixes/adjustments still to be made). Scraped data has been cleaned. 

Current task:     Creating a linear regression for several stats to fill in missing values. 

Next steps:       Input missing values, then convert historical data to format compatible with data scraped for future events. Then build models.
