/**
 * This file serves as the main API route handler for tRPC requests in a Next.js application.
 * It acts as a bridge between client-side tRPC queries/mutations and server-side procedures by:
 * - Receiving and processing all tRPC requests
 * - Setting up request context with headers
 * - Routing requests to appropriate procedures in appRouter
 * - Handling errors (with detailed logging in development)
 * - Returning results to the client
 * 
 * The handler is exported for both GET and POST methods to handle all types of tRPC requests.
